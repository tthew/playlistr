  "readme": "Heroku client API for node\n==========================\n\nWelcome to this (almost) untested, mostly rip-off of [heroku/heroku.rb](https://github.com/heroku/heroku.rb).\n\nThis module provides exactly the same API as heroku's official client. Each function has been carefully fed to monkeys who, through patience and understanding, had been trained to translate basic ruby into coffee script.\n\n<table>\n  <tr><td><img src=\"https://github.com/toots/node-heroku/raw/master/misc/monkey.png\" alt=\"A monkey in action\" title=\"A monkey in action\"/></td></tr>\n  <tr><td>A monkey in action</td></tr>\n</table>\n\nThose monkeys' education cost a lot so we could not afford tests for this code. However, we guarantee that no animal was hurt while preparing this module.\n\nHow to use?\n===========\n\nAPI exported by this module is _exactly_ the same as API exported by  [heroku/heroku.rb](https://github.com/heroku/heroku.rb). Yes, this also means that some variables are not camelCased. We apologize in advance for this inconvenience and, most regretfully, have to deny any liability regarding any possible eye injury while inspecting this code.\n\nThat being said, here's a sample use, which is also the only one actually tested:\n\n    heroku = require(\"heroku\");\n    client = new heroku.Heroku({key: \"deadbeef\"});\n    client.get_releases(\"my_app\", function (error, result) {\n      (...your code here...)\n    });\n\nFor those who prefer to have it with more caffeine, here's the same example in [coffee-script](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script):\n\n    {Heroku} = require \"heroku\"\n    client   = new Heroku\n      key : \"deadbeef\"\n\n    client.get_releases \"my_app\", (error, result) ->\n      (..your code here..)\n",
